INSTALLATION
Just create a the directory SublimeArtisan in your Sublime Text Packages directory, and you're ready to go.

Just press Cmd + Shift + P for the dropdown command list, and search for Artisan, and pick your command :D

NOTE: At the current moment, for the plugin to run correctly the artisan file needs to been in the root folder of your structure in the Side bar.

This is a young plugin, still needs alot of testing.
Give some feedback. Thanks.
